****************README*******************

This code is written using Python 3.8.0.

Libraries and packages that needs to be installed:
1) numpy 
2) matplotlib
3) pandas
4) nltk

To install "nltk", go to your intrepreter (I have used Jupyter itself), and type the following script
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download()


Steps for executing the program:

*****working with the dummy_centroid_maker.py****

1) Open the file "dummy_centroid_maker.py"
2) On line 53 and 55 change the directory path as needed
3) Run the file.
4) After successful execution, this should create a new file "dummycentroids.txt" where it stores a list of dummy centroids that will help for the k means algorithm to work.



****working with the kmeans.py****

4) Open the file "kmeans.py".
5) On the line 148, 150, 152, 154 change the directory as needed. I have commented inside the program to understand where to change what.
6) Run the file.
7) After successful execution, this should create a file "k_means_results" 
8) This file contains the calculation of SSE and cluster formation.
